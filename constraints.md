## What are the constraints that might be there? 

**Preproduction phase**:

Whether the game developing studio is small or large group the issue is very common as employee tends to skip this phase. During game production phase many design decisions are made which is extremely risky and may harm the product. We might create excitement game, attractive graphics, renowned music and better sound effect but if these qualities don’t bind together then we fail to produce a great game. We try to overcome such situation by beginning the preproduction phase to have a strong vision which is absolutely necessary for victorious game development.

**Prototyping**:

Deciding whether the features are authentic can be troublesome and tricky to overcome. The process of implementation can be problematic when it doesn’t work, in such situation do we improvise or just cut it completely? If we remove it, we might lose the significant characteristic that needed more effort and time but if we labour more on it, we may lose more and more of our working time. We should weight the pros and cons and should overall understand and analyse the time to complete in order to get better result. For this reason, an experience plays a vital role to determine and manage as to hold effective outcome. 

**Project estimation**:

It can be really hard for any project to be estimated as it is mainly true when it comes to video games. For any company which is changing rapidly we must keep tight on our schedules or else we might get irritated or frustrated or end up executing new ideas until the end. A cool feature always sound cool, but do we have the time to accomplish? Does the profit gained outweigh the cost? How much do we need to rewrite the code? These few questionnaires we need to answer before we start anything new. Thus having a quality management is the key feature in every aspect of development process for productive achievement.

**People risk**:

Is it due to the fact that it requires team participation to complete the given task where a poor correlation among the team members with poor staff morale may cause such issue while this is the most unfortunate and most command risk that can happen in a project. As this matter hinders in the development process and bring serious damage in the steps of production so a quality communication with a better understanding in the task must be maintained at any time.

**Organisational risk**:

 Uncertainty and lack of resources which include materials, legal, security, budget, time as well as human resources can strike a project at any time. In order to avoid such circumstances team mush have organised plan and assign the management work to someone to keep the daily record as well to inform the deadline of the project.
Technical issue:
A suitable game engine must be selected for the project if not problem may arise while integrating third party tool such as game coding engine from the internet. The most common language for game development is C++ and Java and if we tend to use Unity for our game project as they don’t support C++as scripting language. So, this demands a period of time to learn and understand and manipulate them hence an appropriate selection is required to prevent the risk.

**Legal Issue**:

It is most significant to keep our ideas and codes confidential but that it doesn’t meant to be lock down. Copyright law aims to protect the intellectual property and give exclusive right to the author of creative work. According to the given scenario, a customer wishes to develop an educational video game which requires a set of reading about the history of Atlantic as it brings a copyright issue. Thus, a copyright licence is required after the completion of game and needs to register for copyright to protect the game product.
