#### Question 1

#### Question 2

Whenever a developer makes a video game, they must take into consideration the usability (user-friendliness) of the game. 
For instance, the customers and consumers should be able to navigate to any part the game without having difficulty in trying.
The game should either contain links to other content in the game or display all the content on one page. This leads on to the next point of how people with disabilities would be able to interact with the game.
There are some customers and consumers who may have some learning difficulties which either mental or physical who may have a hard time interacting with the game. 
The game should allow for other software or hardware to run with the game to aid those who have disabilities.
In addition to this, the way the information should be provided to the customer should be something that needs to be clarified.
For example, there should either be information given in the readings for the customer to read and understand or there should be puzzles which can be solved by reading the information provided.
Whatever the option, it should be easy for the consumer to get the information at any given time.
 
Moreover, we should consider whether the game should be single-player or multiplayer based and whether the game should be puzzle-based, 1st person or both.
All these clarifications will depend on the customer’s requirement and the current external situations.
A single-player game involves one person playing the game whereas a multiplayer game works through a server where many users can play the game. 
Puzzle-based games would typically be suited for single-player mode whilst 1st person games tend to work better in a multiplayer environment.
Another point to consider is whether the game will be competitive or collaborative.
This ties in with a multiplayer scenario as this kind of setup can be done with either option.
However, considering the brief, where they mention a possibility of a high score table, a multiplayer game may be better set with a competitive attitude than a collaborative attitude.
 
In addition to this, we should also consider about the content displayed on the game.
Since the main consumers of the product will be university students, mild violent or moral content could be shown, which could help them understand the history better.
On the other hand, we may have to respect some customers’ and consumers’ beliefs and so as a result, may not decide to put any violent or moral content in the game.
We should also consider how long the game is going to available on the store for customers to purchase.
Too short a duration means not enough time for the customer to decide whether to get the game.
Too long could eventually lead to the game’s decreasing popularity, meaning less profit for the company developing the game.
Another point to consider is whether this game should be online or offline (should it require the internet or not).
In terms of accessibility to the game, the game should be made offline as then many customers would be able to buy the game more easily than online.
The program size is another thing to consider as too big a program would eat up too much of the storage on the device the customer decides to use to install the game on.
The final point to decide on is what devices will the game be compatible on.
The game could be available to laptops, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles (such as the Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo Switch) or any other device.

#### Question 3
## What are the constraints that might be there? 

**Preproduction phase**:

Whether the game developing studio is small or large group the issue is very common as employee tends to skip this phase. During game production phase many design decisions are made which is extremely risky and may harm the product. We might create excitement game, attractive graphics, renowned music and better sound effect but if these qualities don’t bind together then we fail to produce a great game. We try to overcome such situation by beginning the preproduction phase to have a strong vision which is absolutely necessary for victorious game development.

**Prototyping**:

Deciding whether the features are authentic can be troublesome and tricky to overcome. The process of implementation can be problematic when it doesn’t work, in such situation do we improvise or just cut it completely? If we remove it, we might lose the significant characteristic that needed more effort and time but if we labour more on it, we may lose more and more of our working time. We should weight the pros and cons and should overall understand and analyse the time to complete in order to get better result. For this reason, an experience plays a vital role to determine and manage as to hold effective outcome. 

**Project estimation**:

It can be really hard for any project to be estimated as it is mainly true when it comes to video games. For any company which is changing rapidly we must keep tight on our schedules or else we might get irritated or frustrated or end up executing new ideas until the end. A cool feature always sound cool, but do we have the time to accomplish? Does the profit gained outweigh the cost? How much do we need to rewrite the code? These few questionnaires we need to answer before we start anything new. Thus having a quality management is the key feature in every aspect of development process for productive achievement.

**People risk**:

Is it due to the fact that it requires team participation to complete the given task where a poor correlation among the team members with poor staff morale may cause such issue while this is the most unfortunate and most command risk that can happen in a project. As this matter hinders in the development process and bring serious damage in the steps of production so a quality communication with a better understanding in the task must be maintained at any time.

**Organisational risk**:

 Uncertainty and lack of resources which include materials, legal, security, budget, time as well as human resources can strike a project at any time. In order to avoid such circumstances team mush have organised plan and assign the management work to someone to keep the daily record as well to inform the deadline of the project.
Technical issue:
A suitable game engine must be selected for the project if not problem may arise while integrating third party tool such as game coding engine from the internet. The most common language for game development is C++ and Java and if we tend to use Unity for our game project as they don’t support C++as scripting language. So, this demands a period of time to learn and understand and manipulate them hence an appropriate selection is required to prevent the risk.

**Legal Issue**:

It is most significant to keep our ideas and codes confidential but that it doesn’t meant to be lock down. Copyright law aims to protect the intellectual property and give exclusive right to the author of creative work. According to the given scenario, a customer wishes to develop an educational video game which requires a set of reading about the history of Atlantic as it brings a copyright issue. Thus, a copyright licence is required after the completion of game and needs to register for copyright to protect the game product.
