#### Introduction
The aim is to create the software.

#### Question 1

#### Question 2

Whenever a developer makes a video game, they must take into consideration the usability (user-friendliness) of the game. 
For instance, the customers and consumers should be able to navigate to any part the game without having difficulty in trying.
The game should either contain links to other content in the game or display all the content on one page. This leads on to the next point of how people with disabilities would be able to interact with the game.
There are some customers and consumers who may have some learning difficulties which either mental or physical who may have a hard time interacting with the game. 
The game should allow for other software or hardware to run with the game to aid those who have disabilities.
In addition to this, the way the information should be provided to the customer should be something that needs to be clarified.
For example, there should either be information given in the readings for the customer to read and understand or there should be puzzles which can be solved by reading the information provided.
Whatever the option, it should be easy for the consumer to get the information at any given time.
 
Moreover, we should consider whether the game should be single-player or multiplayer based and whether the game should be puzzle-based, 1st person or both.
All these clarifications will depend on the customer’s requirement and the current external situations.
A single-player game involves one person playing the game whereas a multiplayer game works through a server where many users can play the game. 
Puzzle-based games would typically be suited for single-player mode whilst 1st person games tend to work better in a multiplayer environment.
Another point to consider is whether the game will be competitive or collaborative.
This ties in with a multiplayer scenario as this kind of setup can be done with either option.
However, considering the brief, where they mention a possibility of a high score table, a multiplayer game may be better set with a competitive attitude than a collaborative attitude.
 
In addition to this, we should also consider about the content displayed on the game.
Since the main consumers of the product will be university students, mild violent or moral content could be shown, which could help them understand the history better.
On the other hand, we may have to respect some customers’ and consumers’ beliefs and so as a result, may not decide to put any violent or moral content in the game.
We should also consider how long the game is going to available on the store for customers to purchase.
Too short a duration means not enough time for the customer to decide whether to get the game.
Too long could eventually lead to the game’s decreasing popularity, meaning less profit for the company developing the game.
Another point to consider is whether this game should be online or offline (should it require the internet or not).
In terms of accessibility to the game, the game should be made offline as then many customers would be able to buy the game more easily than online.
The program size is another thing to consider as too big a program would eat up too much of the storage on the device the customer decides to use to install the game on.
The final point to decide on is what devices will the game be compatible on.
The game could be available to laptops, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles (such as the Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo Switch) or any other device.
