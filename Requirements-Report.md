#### Introduction

Our team has been tasked to create a game product for a customer.
The objective is to create an educational video game in the form of a first person puzzle game.
This is going to be for the target audience of university students studying the history of the Atlantic, meaning the age range will be for mature individuals 18+ with at least a basic knowledge of history.
We will also be including a high score table to include some kind of competitiveness to the game which will also encouraging the users to compare to others and try to beat own or others high scores.
We will be looking at the requirements of the product, points to be clarified from customer, and constraints included. 

#### Abstract
 An educational objective to encourage university students to study set of readings on history about slave trade and privacy and to discuss the proceeding selling on educational video games.

#### Background
The general background gathered while intergating the third party tool such as game coding engine and manipulate them to develop a educational software that opens the door of education through video games to engage university student.

#### Question 1

The team will have to research some understanding of the history of the Atlantic in order to know what kind of information to include in the end product. We will use the information given to us in form of the book by Catherine Amstrong & Laura M Chmielewski, 2013, “The Atlantic Experience: peoples, places, ideas”, Palgrave Macmillan, Houndmills, Basingstoke, which is also available online.[1]

After clarifying with the customer on the specifics of the end product. We will have to plan an accurate budget and inform the customer of this before beginning any work on the product as it may come as a shock to the customer to find, with all information finalised, that the product will cost more than that which they had thought. We will also have to take into account the price of the software/hardware we may need if it is not already available for use.

As not all students may be academically equal, some students may need extra time to read questions, there may have to be a narrator reading questions out, or possibly there may be a requirement to not have any form of time restraint on the product and possibly leave the scoring up to other methods such as lives and/or points. This is only to ensure this is an inclusive game that does not discriminate against other students. Will need to refer to the customer to find out what kind of students this product will be made for and if it is an academically mixed set, then safeguards may need to be put in place.

Customer has not specified if the product will be for one time use for students or will it have to be reusable for other students or other years. Will the customer want the product to be transferable or can it be edited for other educational programs at a later date? Also will the customer want the product to be web based or created as a downloadable application?

What is the level of understanding that the students have for the history of the atlantic? How difficult does the customer want the product? Will the customer want the user to be able to select varying levels of difficulty i.e. easy, medium, hard etc. or will the customer want the game to be level based i.e. start off at level one and progress through increasingly difficult levels.

Does the customer have a desired colour scheme for the product? Are there any specific graphics that the customer will want to have included into the product i.e. university logo/colours.

#### Question 2

Whenever a developer makes a video game, they must take into consideration the usability (user-friendliness) of the game. 
For instance, the customers and consumers should be able to navigate to any part the game without having difficulty in trying.
The game should either contain links to other content in the game or display all the content on one page. This leads on to the next point of how people with disabilities would be able to interact with the game.
There are some customers and consumers who may have some learning difficulties which either mental or physical who may have a hard time interacting with the game. 
The game should allow for other software or hardware to run with the game to aid those who have disabilities.
In addition to this, the way the information should be provided to the customer should be something that needs to be clarified.
For example, there should either be information given in the readings for the customer to read and understand or there should be puzzles which can be solved by reading the information provided.
Whatever the option, it should be easy for the consumer to get the information at any given time.
 
Moreover, we should consider whether the game should be single-player or multiplayer based and whether the game should be puzzle-based, 1st person or both.
All these clarifications will depend on the customer’s requirement and the current external situations.
A single-player game involves one person playing the game whereas a multiplayer game works through a server where many users can play the game. 
Puzzle-based games would typically be suited for single-player mode whilst 1st person games tend to work better in a multiplayer environment.
Another point to consider is whether the game will be competitive or collaborative.
This ties in with a multiplayer scenario as this kind of setup can be done with either option.
However, considering the brief, where they mention a possibility of a high score table, a multiplayer game may be better set with a competitive attitude than a collaborative attitude.
 
In addition to this, we should also consider about the content displayed on the game.
Since the main consumers of the product will be university students, mild violent or moral content could be shown, which could help them understand the history better.
On the other hand, we may have to respect some customers’ and consumers’ beliefs and so as a result, may not decide to put any violent or moral content in the game.
We should also consider how long the game is going to available on the store for customers to purchase.
Too short a duration means not enough time for the customer to decide whether to get the game.
Too long could eventually lead to the game’s decreasing popularity, meaning less profit for the company developing the game.
Another point to consider is whether this game should be online or offline (should it require the internet or not).
In terms of accessibility to the game, the game should be made offline as then many customers would be able to buy the game more easily than online.
The program size is another thing to consider as too big a program would eat up too much of the storage on the device the customer decides to use to install the game on.
The final point to decide on is what devices will the game be compatible on.
The game could be available to laptops, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles (such as the Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo Switch) or any other device.

#### Question 3

**Preproduction phase**:

Whether the game developing studio is a small or large group, the issue is very common as employees tend to skip this phase. During game production phase, many design decisions are made which is extremely risky and may harm the product. We might create an exciting game with attractive graphics, renowned music and better sound effects, but if these qualities don’t bind together then we fail to produce a great game. We try to overcome such situation by beginning in the preproduction phase to have a strong vision which is absolutely necessary for successful game development.

**Prototyping**:

Deciding whether the features are authentic can be troublesome and tricky to overcome. The process of implementation can be problematic when it doesn’t work. In such situation do we improvise or just cut it completely? If we remove it, we might lose the significant characteristic that needed more effort and time but if we labour more on it, we may lose more and more of our working time. We should weigh the pros and cons and should overall understand and analyse the time to complete in order to get a better result. For this reason, an experience plays a vital role to determine and manage as to hold effective outcome. 

**Project estimation**:

It can be really hard for any project to be estimated as it is mainly true when it comes to video games. For any company which is changing rapidly we must keep tight on our schedules or else we might get irritated or frustrated or end up executing new ideas until the end. A cool feature always sounds cool, but do we have the time to accomplish it? Does the profit gained outweigh the cost? How much do we need to rewrite the code? These are the few questionnaires we need to answer before we start anything new. Thus having a quality management is the key feature in every aspect of the development process for productive achievement.

**People risk**:

Is it due to the fact that it requires team participation to complete the given task where a poor correlation among the team members with poor staff morale may cause such issue. This is the most unfortunate and most command risk that can happen in a project. As this matter hinders in the development process and brings serious damage in the steps of production, so quality communication with a better understanding in the task must be maintained at all time.

**Organisational risk**:

 Uncertainty and lack of resources which include materials, legal, security, budget, time as well as human resources can strike a project at any time. In order to avoid such circumstances, the team must have an organised plan and assign the management work to someone to keep the daily record as well as to inform the deadline of the project.

**Technical issue**:

As the customer gives the requirements that they wish the game would include, you would need to consider several factors so that they can actually be done such as the time given to complete the tasks, the budget if there is enough money to start and complete the project.
When creating the game, the customer should give the system specifications of the computer or devices where game will be played on. This is so the developers will know the requirements of the specification and will be able to develop the game suited for the device allowing them to run on the devices as it will be of no use if they can’t run the game on the computers they have.
A system specification that would be required for the customer to give would be the type of operating system that the devices use e.g. Windows, Linux, IOS, Android etc. Other system requirements that must be known is the processor and memory as the processor allows the game to run effective so if the game was developed the required a faster processor than the one the computers have the game would run as well. Whereas memory is used to store information and data of the game e.g. the actual game size and when the game is running the temporary data such as score. Knowing the type of processor and memory allows to develop the game so that the computers can run the game effectively and efficiently.
Also a suitable game engine must be selected for the project if not problem may arise while integrating third party tool such as game coding engine from the internet. The most common language for game development is C++ and Java and if we tend to use Unity for our game project as they don’t support C++as scripting language. So, this demands a period of time to learn and understand and manipulate them hence an appropriate selection is required to prevent the risk.

**Legal Issue**:

When creating the game, the developers may use software to develop the game such as Unity which would mean they would need to follow their software license if the game is made to sell.
Another legal constraint is that when the game is being developed there is confidentiality to ensure that the game is kept secure and that the idea isn’t taken away by other people and take ownership although the purpose of the game is educational it could still be commercialised. As the game is being created from the customers requirements there would be different teams working on the project e.g. the designers, developers etc so everyone whose working on the project would be required to keep the information a secret. Copyright law aims to protect the intellectual property and give exclusive right to the author of the creative work. According to the given scenario, a customer wishes to develop an educational video game which requires a set of readings about the history of Atlantic as it brings a copyright issue. Thus, a copyright licence is required after the completion of the game and needs to register for copyright to protect the game product. For further security signing a NDA (non-disclosure agreement) or getting intellectual property of the game can be done.

#### Question 4
Firstly, the customer needs to decide what game they want to implement for their students. 
In the brief, two ideas were suggested, one of the ideas being a puzzled based game or a 1st person adventure. 
From the two ideas, one must be decided so that we are able to develop a plan according to which game the customer wants. 
If the customer wants to develop a puzzle game, then a set of questions can be used as puzzle. 
As there are various ways to develop a puzzle the customer will need to decide what the best idea is for a game.
A puzzle will most likely include the students to solve the puzzle by reading the statements. 
Another way of having a puzzle based game is if they need to match the description to the words.  

On the other hand, if the customer wanted a 1st person adventure, then more thought and decisions will to be made. 
A 1st person adventure will require more time for the game to make. 
Not knowing what type of game the customer wants can lead to unnecessary problems.
It is important to know what game the customer wants so that the development of the game can start quicker. 

Deciding if the game will be single player or multiplayer could be point that will need clarification first. 
The customer could decide to have a single player game to which a game can be made from. 
Clarifying that the customer wants a single player game could lead to changes being made about the game.
For example, a puzzle would be best suited as a single player game. 
Whereas a 1st person adventure would be best suited as a multiplayer game. 
This is because more than one person would be able to join a server for the 1st person adventure game. 

Deadlines must be decided as well and should be one of the points that should be clarified first.
There is no set deadline for this project. This could lead to delays in the project. 
Hence, having a deadline will allow the developers to follow a certain time frame of planning and the making of the game.
“The reason that it is important to meet deadlines is so that the recipient receives the quality standard and meeting deadlines also avoids any unnecessary delays.” [2]


The topics of the game have also not been decided. 
There should be a clear idea of what topics the game will include thus, the developers will know what content to include within the game.
As stated in the brief, the readings are about The Atlantic. 
There are various topics within the subject so the customer will need to decide which topics to include in the game.
Furthermore, the customer must decide on what type of questions the topic will contain. 
Therefore, deciding what topics are on the game should be one of the points that will need to be clarified first.
